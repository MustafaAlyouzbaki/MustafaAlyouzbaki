- 👋 Hi, I’m @MustafaAlyouzbaki
- 👀 I’m interested in ...
      studying cognitive science including psychology, philosophy, neuroscience, anthropology, and computer science. 
      I love the prospects of artificial intelligence and how it can fundamentally shift our entire future as a species, including how we can implement it to
      automate tedious tasks which require human intelligence so we can improve everyone's quality of life, much like the internet or modern medical technology has in the past.
      
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
      Computing with a Cognitive Science specialization (BCmpH) at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.
      
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
      many projects as long as I challenge myself because I currently understand the fundamentals of computing and object oriented programming. I've played
      around with GUI's and a bit of web development but I want to make more interesting projects to put on my portfolio since I have only done relatively
      basic projects that were in my comfort zone.
      
- 📫 You can reach me at...
      mus.alyouzbaki@gmail.com if you have some project ideas that you want to collaborate on, if it is interesting and within my scope then I would definitely
      consider doing it.
